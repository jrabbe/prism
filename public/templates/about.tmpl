<h1>About PRISM</h1>

<p>
    Not too long about there was a lot of discussion about the NSA surveilance program <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a>. In the midst of this I read Kieran Healy's article on Slate about <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/">Using Metadata To Find Paul Revere</a>.

    I found this article so interesting that I set off doing the same looking at my Facebook friends and their groups. You can see the first attempt in my <a href="https://github.com/jrabbe/prism">PRISM github repo</a> in the <em>old</em> folder.
